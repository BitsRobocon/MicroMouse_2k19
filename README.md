This repository contains Code, articles, videos,cad model and snapshots taken during the preparations for competition micromouse

# 3 basic subdivisions- 
  1. Electronics and components
  2. Solving Algorithm
  3. Coding
  
# 1. Electronics and components -   
-STM32 as the microcontroller(can be coded from Arduino ide)(!3.3v)
https://robu.in/product/stm32f103c8t6-minimum-system-board-microcomputer-stm32-arm-core-board/

-5 IR distance sensors( 2 on each side and one on the front)
https://robu.in/product/sharp-ir-distance-measuring-sensor-unit-4-30-cm-cable/

-Roughly 3 cm for now diameter wheels from polulu

-Motors according to wheel size and weight(not yet decided)

-9 axis gyro(Adafruit Precision NXP 9-DOF Breakout Board - FXOS8700 + FXAS21002) 
https://www.adafruit.com/product/3463

similar sensor
mpu 9250
(but we found out that adafruit sensor is the best at the time)

-Motor drivers(mostly a pcb based l293d module)

-Battery(not decided)
